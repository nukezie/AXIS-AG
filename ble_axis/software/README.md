### Setup
1. Clone the BLE Axis repository
2. Navigate to the software directory:
   ```bash
   cd ble_axis/software
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the test suite to verify installation:
   ```bash
   python test_mics_identification.py
   ```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from mics_device_identification import MICSDeviceIdentifier

# Initialize the identifier
identifier = MICSDeviceIdentifier()

# Identify a device by MAC address
mac_address = "00:11:22:33:44:55"
device = identifier.identify_device(mac_address)

if device:
    print(f"Device: {device.model}")
    print(f"Manufacturer: {device.manufacturer.value}")
    print(f"Type: {device.device_type.value}")
    print(f"Security Level: {device.security_level.value}")
```

### RF Signature Analysis

```python
from mics_device_identification import DeviceSignature

# Create RF signature for analysis
rf_signature = DeviceSignature(
    mac_address="00:11:22:33:44:66",
    frequency_hopping_pattern=[2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
    packet_structure={"size": 128, "type": "data"},
    timing_characteristics={"interval": 500, "jitter": 10},
    modulation_type="FSK",
    data_rate=100,
    power_variations=[25.0, 24.8, 25.1],
    interference_patterns=[]
)

# Identify device with RF signature
device = identifier.identify_device("00:11:22:33:44:66", rf_signature)
```

### Security Analysis

```python
# Generate security report
report = identifier.generate_security_report()

print(f"Total devices: {report['total_devices']}")
print(f"Critical devices: {report['security_summary']['critical']}")
print(f"High security devices: {report['security_summary']['high']}")

# Get devices by security level
critical_devices = identifier.get_devices_by_security_level(SecurityLevel.CRITICAL)
for device in critical_devices:
    print(f"Critical device: {device.model} ({device.mac_address})")
```

## Integration with BLE Axis

### Firmware Integration
The MICS device identification system integrates with the BLE Axis firmware through the MICS module:

```c
typedef struct {
    // Device Identification
    mics_device_identifier_t device_identifier;
    device_database_t device_database;
    security_analyzer_t security_analyzer;
} mics_module_t;
```

### Hardware Integration
- CC1101RGPR transceiver for MICS band (402-405 MHz)
- 10-channel frequency monitoring
- Power level monitoring (25 Î¼W EIRP limit)
- Duty cycle tracking (0.1% maximum)

### User Interface Integration
The system provides data for the MICS Scanner and Analyzer interfaces in the BLE Axis user interface.

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All device data encrypted at rest
- Secure transmission of device information
- Encrypted database storage

### Access Control
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication for critical operations
- Audit logging for all device access

### Compliance
- FCC Part 95 MICS band compliance
- FDA medical device regulations
- HIPAA privacy and security compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Database Connection Errors**
```
Error: Database initialization failed
Solution: Check file permissions and disk space
```

**2. MAC Address Format Issues**
```
Error: Invalid MAC address format
Solution: Ensure MAC address is in format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

**3. Device Not Found**
```
Error: Device not identified
Solution: Check if device is in database or add new device
```

### Debug Mode
```python
# Enable debug logging
logging.getLogger('mics_device_identification').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Enable verbose output
identifier = MICSDeviceIdentifier()
identifier.debug_mode = True
```
