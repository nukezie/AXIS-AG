# AXIOM-25 Matrix — Planner Controller Specification

## Objective
Define the Planner controller specification for search-aware planning with Graph-of-Thought construction and branch scoring.

## Scope
- Graph-of-Thought (GoT) construction
- Search-aware planning strategies
- Branch scoring and selection
- PRM (Process Reward Model) integration
- Planning optimization

## Inputs
- [DOC-CORE-FIVE-AXIS](/docs/core/five_axis_doctrine.md) - Five-axis doctrine
- [DOC-PLAN-SEARCH-NODE](/docs/planning/search_node_design.md) - Search node design

## Dependencies
- DOC-CORE-FIVE-AXIS
- DOC-PLAN-SEARCH-NODE

## Acceptance & Traceability
- **Acceptance:** Planner controller provides effective search-aware planning and GoT construction
- **Traceability:** Referenced by Control Plane and planning execution
