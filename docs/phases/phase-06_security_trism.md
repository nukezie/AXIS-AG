## KPIs
- **Security Coverage:** 100% of identified threats mitigated
- **Redaction Effectiveness:** 100% of PII properly redacted
- **Sandbox Security:** 100% of dangerous operations blocked
- **Incident Response:** < 5 minutes to activate incident mode

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Security Performance Impact
- **Mitigation:** Efficient security controls and caching
- **Fallback:** Graceful degradation with security warnings

### Risk: False Positives in Redaction
- **Mitigation:** Careful PII detection tuning
- **Fallback:** Manual review for borderline cases

### Risk: Sandbox Bypass
- **Mitigation:** Multiple layers of isolation
- **Fallback:** Disable untrusted tools entirely

### Risk: Incident Mode Complexity
- **Mitigation:** Clear procedures and automation
- **Fallback:** Manual incident response procedures

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Disable problematic security features
2. Revert to basic security controls
3. Document issues in ADR
4. Simplify approach and retry
