## SLO Overview

This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the bridge access resilience capability. These SLOs establish measurable targets for system performance, availability, and resilience under various network conditions.

#### Measurement Method
```
Availability = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time × 100%
```

#### Measurement Method
```
Circuit Establishment Time = Time from request to circuit ready
```

- **Retention:** 6 months of historical data

### SLO-003: Failover Time
**Objective:** Ensure rapid failover when primary paths fail

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Target:** < 5 seconds for automatic failover
- **Acceptable:** < 10 seconds for manual failover
- **Minimum:** < 30 seconds for complex scenarios

#### Measurement Method
```
Failover Time = Time from failure detection to new circuit active
```

#### Data Collection
- **Source:** Failover event logs and telemetry
- **Frequency:** Per failover event
- **Retention:** 1 year of historical data

### SLO-004: End-to-End Latency
**Objective:** Maintain acceptable latency for user traffic

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Target:** < 100ms for 95% of connections
- **Acceptable:** < 200ms for 90% of connections
- **Minimum:** < 500ms for 85% of connections

#### Measurement Method
```
End-to-End Latency = Round-trip time measurement
```

#### Data Collection
- **Source:** Data plane telemetry and ping tests
- **Frequency:** Continuous monitoring with 5-second intervals
- **Retention:** 3 months of historical data

### SLO-005: Throughput Performance
**Objective:** Maintain acceptable throughput under normal conditions

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Target:** > 90% of baseline throughput
- **Acceptable:** > 80% of baseline throughput
- **Minimum:** > 60% of baseline throughput

#### Measurement Method
```
Throughput Performance = Actual Throughput / Baseline Throughput × 100%
```

#### Data Collection
- **Source:** Bandwidth utilization monitoring
- **Frequency:** Continuous monitoring with 1-minute intervals
- **Retention:** 6 months of historical data

### SLO-006: Packet Loss Rate
**Objective:** Minimize packet loss in the network

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Target:** < 0.1% packet loss
- **Acceptable:** < 1% packet loss
- **Minimum:** < 5% packet loss

#### Measurement Method
```
Packet Loss Rate = (Sent Packets - Received Packets) / Sent Packets × 100%
```

#### Data Collection
- **Source:** Network interface statistics
- **Frequency:** Continuous monitoring with 10-second intervals
- **Retention:** 3 months of historical data

## Impairment-Specific SLOs

### SLO-007: Latency Impairment Resilience
**Objective:** Maintain performance under latency impairments

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Baseline Latency (0-50ms):** All primary SLOs must be met
- **Moderate Latency (50-200ms):** SLO-001, SLO-002, SLO-003 must be met
- **High Latency (200-500ms):** SLO-001 and SLO-003 must be met
- **Extreme Latency (500-1000ms):** SLO-001 must be met

#### Measurement Method
```
Resilience Score = (Met SLOs / Total SLOs) × 100%
```

### SLO-008: Packet Loss Resilience
**Objective:** Maintain performance under packet loss conditions

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Low Packet Loss (0.1-1%):** All primary SLOs must be met
- **Moderate Packet Loss (1-10%):** SLO-001, SLO-002, SLO-003 must be met
- **High Packet Loss (10-50%):** SLO-001 and SLO-003 must be met

#### Measurement Method
```
Resilience Score = (Met SLOs / Total SLOs) × 100%
```

### SLO-009: Bandwidth Constraint Resilience
**Objective:** Maintain performance under bandwidth limitations

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Normal Bandwidth (>50% of baseline):** All primary SLOs must be met
- **Reduced Bandwidth (10-50% of baseline):** SLO-001, SLO-002, SLO-003 must be met
- **Limited Bandwidth (<10% of baseline):** SLO-001 and SLO-003 must be met

#### Measurement Method
```
Resilience Score = (Met SLOs / Total SLOs) × 100%
```

## Composite SLOs

### SLO-010: Overall System Resilience
**Objective:** Measure overall system resilience across all impairment scenarios

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Target:** > 90% resilience score across all impairment campaigns
- **Acceptable:** > 80% resilience score across all impairment campaigns
- **Minimum:** > 70% resilience score across all impairment campaigns

#### Measurement Method
```
Overall Resilience = Σ(Impairment Category Scores) / Number of Categories
```

### SLO-011: User Experience Quality
**Objective:** Measure quality of user experience under various conditions

#### Measurement Criteria
- **Target:** > 95% user satisfaction score
- **Acceptable:** > 85% user satisfaction score
- **Minimum:** > 75% user satisfaction score

#### Measurement Method
```
User Experience Score = f(Latency, Throughput, Availability, Failover Time)
```
