# Bridge Access Resilience Capability Research Program

**Classification Level:** RESTRICTED  
**Program Authority:** Department of Defence Research Program  
**ROE Reference:** Current Rules of Engagement (ROE) and Operational Mandate  
**Access Control:** Authorized Personnel Only  

## Program Overview

This research program focuses on developing controlled-environment bridge access resilience capabilities for Department of Defence operational requirements. The program implements comprehensive testing methodologies for bridge entry relays, capture bypasses, and network impairment modeling.

## Security Considerations

- **Classification Handling:** All technical data classified as RESTRICTED
- **Access Control:** Role-based access with audit logging
- **Network Isolation:** Controlled lab environment only
- **Data Protection:** Encrypted storage and transmission

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Authorized Use Only:** This capability is for approved research purposes only
2. **Lab Environment:** All testing must be conducted in controlled lab environments
3. **Documentation:** All activities must be documented and logged
4. **Compliance:** Adherence to ROE and operational mandates required
