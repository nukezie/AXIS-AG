**Document Classification:** RESTRICTED  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** [Current Date]  

## Architecture Overview

The bridge access resilience testing environment consists of multiple interconnected components designed to simulate real-world network conditions and measure resilience capabilities under various impairment scenarios.

## Network Components

### 1. Bridge Entry Points
```
[Internet] → [Border Gateway] → [Bridge Entry Relays] → [Core Network]
```

**Components:**
- **Border Gateway:** Initial entry point with traffic filtering
- **Bridge Entry Relays:** Multiple relay nodes for redundancy
- **Load Balancer:** Traffic distribution across relay nodes
- **Authentication Gateway:** Access control and user verification

### 2. Core Network Infrastructure
```
[Relay Nodes] → [Impairment Layer] → [Telemetry Collection] → [Analysis Engine]
```

**Components:**
- **Impairment Layer:** ToxiProxy, tc/netem for network simulation
- **Telemetry Collection:** Real-time data gathering from control and data planes
- **Analysis Engine:** SLO measurement and resilience analysis
- **Storage Layer:** Encrypted data storage for metrics and logs

### 3. Testing Environment Segments

#### Segment A: Control Plane Testing
- Circuit build/fail event monitoring
- Relay selection and failover mechanisms
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Performance baseline measurements

#### Segment B: Data Plane Testing
- Throughput and latency measurements
- Packet loss and jitter analysis
- MTU adjustment testing
- Route black-holing scenarios

#### Segment C: Impairment Simulation
- Network latency injection (0-1000ms)
- Packet loss simulation (0-50%)
- Jitter introduction (0-200ms)
- Bandwidth throttling (1Mbps-1Gbps)
